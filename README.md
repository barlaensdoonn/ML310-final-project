# ML310 FINAL PROJECT
Using the [politwoops](https://projects.propublica.org/politwoops/) dataset, we use machine learning to analyze the tweets, breaking the project up into the following 4 categories:
  * exploratory analysis and text-mining [(notebook)](https://github.com/barlaensdoonn/deletweet/blob/master/notebooks/deletweet-text-mining.ipynb "text-mining notebook")
  * deletion times (how long tweets were live) [(notebook)](https://github.com/barlaensdoonn/deletweet/blob/master/notebooks/deletweet-deletion-times.ipynb "deletion times notebook")
  * sentiment analysis [(notebook)](https://github.com/barlaensdoonn/deletweet/blob/master/notebooks/deletweet-sentiment-analysis.ipynb "sentiment analysis notebook")
  * hashtag recommendation system
